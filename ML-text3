Let's break down and explain each line of the code you've written.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
```
- **Explanation**: Imports the necessary libraries:
  - `pandas` is used for data manipulation and analysis.
  - `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection` is used to split the dataset into training and test sets.
  - `StandardScaler` from `sklearn.preprocessing` is used to normalize the feature values to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
  - `accuracy_score` and `confusion_matrix` from `sklearn.metrics` are used to evaluate the performance of the model.
  - `tensorflow` and `keras` are imported for building and training a neural network model, which can be useful for complex datasets like customer churn.

```python
# 1. Read the dataset
data = pd.read_csv("Churn_Modelling.csv")  # Replace with the actual path to the dataset
data
```
- **Explanation**: Loads the dataset into a DataFrame called `data` using `pd.read_csv()`. This file, `Churn_Modelling.csv`, should contain data about customer churn, likely including various features (like customer demographics, account info, etc.) and a target variable indicating whether a customer has exited.
  - `data` will display the dataset in this environment, which helps in visually verifying the dataset structure.

```python
# 2. Distinguish features and target
X = data.drop("Exited", axis=1)  # Features
y = data["Exited"]  # Target variable
```
- **Explanation**: Splits the dataset into features (`X`) and target (`y`).
  - `X` contains all columns except "Exited," which is dropped using `data.drop("Exited", axis=1)`. The `axis=1` argument specifies that the column, not a row, is being dropped.
  - `y` is assigned the "Exited" column, which is the target variable indicating if a customer exited (churned) or not.

```python
X
```
- **Explanation**: Displays the features (`X`) to verify that the "Exited" column has been removed and check if there are any other issues.

```python
# 2. Divide the dataset into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```
- **Explanation**: Splits `X` and `y` into training and test sets using an 80-20 split.
  - `test_size=0.2` indicates that 20% of the data will be allocated to the test set, and the remaining 80% will be used for training.
  - `random_state=42` ensures that the data split is reproducible, so the same training and test sets will be created each time the code is run.

```python
# 3. Normalize the data
# scaler = StandardScaler()
# X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
# X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
```
- **Explanation**: Normalizes (scales) the feature values in `X_train` and `X_test` to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which often improves model performance for neural networks and other machine learning models.
  - `scaler = StandardScaler()` initializes a `StandardScaler` object.
  - `scaler.fit_transform(X_train)` fits the scaler to the training data and transforms it, scaling the values based on the mean and standard deviation of the training set.
  - `scaler.transform(X_test)` scales the test set based on the scaler fitted on the training set, ensuring consistency in feature scaling between training and test data.

These steps prepare the data for modeling by loading, splitting, and (optionally) normalizing it, which is crucial for achieving reliable results in machine learning models.
